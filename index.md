# Who we are

[We are a group of enthusiasts with varying experience and skills sharing a passionate interest in wild foods. We believe in learning by doing, and in sharing our accumulated knowledge and experiences.](/who-we-are/)

Once upon a time, at the time of the hunters and gatherers, foraging was a way of life. Gathering wild food from nature, with all the skills and knowledge that implies, was necessary for survival.
 
 Nowadays we need look no further than the supermarket shelves for our sustenance, but there is still an enormous satisfaction to be found in harvesting what nature has to offer.   

# What we do

[Our courses are intended to share and develop our skills and knowledge and to demonstrate the enjoyment and satisfaction to be found fishing and foraging for the table.](/who-we-are/)

[The courses, evenings, one day, weekends or longer, are primarily designed for groups of up to twelve participants, but can be adapted to fit in with particular interests and requirements.The programme varies depending on the time of year and other factors](/who-we-are/)

# Shellfish evenings

Guests find their own way out to the boathouse on Nøtholmen or are picked up in Strömstad. Under the guidance of our chef we improve our skills in opening and preparing oysters for the table. What are the classic ways to garnish oysters? We compare native and pacific oysters.

Comfortably seated in the loft of the boathouse our oysters are accompanied by a presentation. We're given an overview of the species. What should we think about when harvesting or buying and preparing shellfish?  Is there a risk of toxins and other hazards? Are there different fishing methods and cultivation possibilities? We take a look at the oyster culture in France, Ireland and the UK.

The rest of the evening is devoted to various shellfish dishes, both classic and innovative. 
We may learn how to dress a boiled crab, grill oysters and norway lobsters and prepare blue mussels and other species depending on the time of year and availability. All that's left is to enjoy the fruits of our labours in the relaxed atmosphere of the loft and in the company of our hosts and fellow guests. 


# Weekend course

A weekend course can start with an ‘oyster evening’ on friday (as above) or, alternatively, ‘brunch’ on saturday morning.

Well fortified with food for both body and mind we head for the fishing grounds. Half an hour's steaming brings us to the first crab pots (or lobster in season) or an hour to our fleets of prawn creels. 

Returning with our catch we visit Syd Längö with its safe harbour and narrow sound where we pick oysters and enjoy a well-earned lunch (grilled oysters?) followed by a hike across the island, along the beach, through forest and across meadows in search of edible plants, berries and mushrooms.

Eventually we return to the boathouse at Nötholmen where we spend the remainder of the day taking care of the day's harvest, composing the menu, preparing the ingredients and enjoying a world-class meal together. Our chef and (optional) sommelier contribute to the experience.
