Hanna developed an early interest in edible and medicinal plants encouraged by her grandfather who lived at the miller's house, a magical spot "at the end of the road and a little bit further" where Hannna spent the summers of her childhood. The house is situated by the old mill with its millstream, below a beautiful lake and surrounded by towering cliffs, forests and meadows which are home to a cornucopia of flora and fauna. Hanna formed a lasting attachment to the property where she now lives with her son Leo, husband Peter, Sammy the Belgian shepherd and a library of botanical and 'self-sufficiency' literature.  The garden is an ongoing projekt. 

After a chequered career which includes lorry-driving. team-building and adventure-training Hanna became a full-time gardener, started her own company more than 15 years ago and now designs, creates and maintains gardens of every shape and size through her company Frejas Haga AB.

Hannas enthusiasm for foraging is unstoppable and she continues to enjoy and develop her interest in wild foods, including algae and other marine and coastal species. Hanna is a key member of the Shellfish Society.

Colin Wheatley started fishing on the island of Jersey in the early 1960's working 300 lobster pots out of Rozel under the legendary skipper Bob Viney. In 1964 he moved to London, trained as a journalist and worked in broadcasting for a decade before buying a ruined cottage in the hebrides where he took up lobster fishing once again. Visiting Sweden in the late 70's he bought a 40 foot fishing boat and fished for cod out of Kårehamn, Öland before moving to the west coast where he found employment as a skipper/technician at Tjärnö Marine Laboratory. 

In the early 1980's he pioneered the trap fishery for norway lobster which currently employs more than 100 vessels and contributes significantly to a year-round economy in numerous fishing communities on the Swedish west coast. Throughout the 1990's and up to his retirement in 2008 he was employed by the University of Gothenburg working in fisheries development and coastal zone management, addressing the difficulties confronting small fishing communities in a number of european countries.

Since retirement in 2008 he has worked as crew on a shrimp trawler, participated in various scientific expeditions, renovated a small, wooden fishing boat and, with a little help from his friends, built a boathouse on the harbour where he organises courses in how to catch, prepare and enjoy a variety of shellfish species.
