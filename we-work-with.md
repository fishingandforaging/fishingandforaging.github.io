A 20 min voyage through the archipelago from the boathouse lies the island of Syd Långö.
The small natural harbour on the eastern side with it’s narrow entrance provides a safe
haven for small craft and the island is a treasure trove for the forager. Meadows and
woodland support an extensive flora and an impressive diversity of shellfish are to be found
on the beaches and along the shoreline.

The island has a fascinating history with remains from the bronze age and a ruined fishmeal
factory from the late 19th century. In 1918 the island was taken over by the Rydbeck family
who created extensive gardens with a variety of unusual species including exotic lillies,
bamboo and asparagus. The family also introduced a number of deciduous trees including
chestnut and a walnut!

In 1952 the island was acquired by the Gränges company who established a holiday centre
for their employees. Since 1978 the island has been owned and run by the Swedish steel
company SSAB who, together with Electrolux AB, continue to provide holiday
accommodation for their staff.

I arrange wine tastings and lecture on wine. I work with private parties as well as associations and companies. I like to highlight origins and winemaking methods at my tastings, and try to find suitable wines to accompany various dishes, textures and tastes, always with the goal that it should be educational and fun!

This year I started higher Diploma studies at WSET School in London where I already have a Level 3 Award in Wines In the summer of 2021 I graduated from Yrgos one-year sommelier training in Gothenburg.

# Resö Gård, Caroline Westman and Kristofer Olsson

<img src="/assets/images/reso_gard.jpg" style="width: 360px;"/>

Caroline Westman and Kristofer Olsson run a small mixed farm on the island of Resö in northern Bohuslän. Eight years ago they acquired a small herd of sheep, not only to graze and restore the traditional landscape, but also to provide local meat products.

Over the years they have added ducks, rabbits, chickens and bees as well as pigs, “Linderödssvin”  who, as well as providing bacon, thoroughly turn-over and enrich the soil. All the fertiliser used on the farm comes from their own animals.

Caroline and Kristofer are more or less self-sufficient in meat and veg.  In addition to staples such as potato, carrot and onion, they grow chard, beetroot, squash, spices, lettuce and cabbage as well as, in the greenhouse, tomatoes, paprika and cucumber. Later in the season they harvest both Jerusalem and globe artichokes, black root and several varieties of pumpkin, both for decoration and food.

In addition to seasonal ‘self-picking’ in the vegetable garden, there is a farm shop offering eggs, lamb, pork, sausages and honey all year round. The farm also produces sheepskins and other woollen products.  Children are always welcome and enjoy getting to know the animals, both big and small. During the winter the couple organise and cater for various events. Kristofer has a background as a chef and prepares all food from the farm's own raw materials. 

Caroline and Kristofer also plan to carry on the Westman family tradition as oyster fisherman, realising a long-standing dream of living and working locally as fisherman-farmers.
