title: "fishing and foraging"
---

We are a group of enthusiasts with varying experience and skills sharing a passionate interest in wild foods. We believe in learning by doing, and in sharing our accumulated knowledge and experiences.

Once upon a time, at the time of the hunters and gatherers, foraging was a way of life. Gathering wild food from nature, with all the skills and knowledge that implies, was necessary for survival. Nowadays we need look no further than the supermarket shelves for our sustenance, but there is still an enormous satisfaction to be found in harvesting what nature has to offer.   

Our courses are intended to share and develop our skills and knowledge and to demonstrate the enjoyment and satisfaction to be found fishing and foraging for the table.

The courses, evenings, one day, weekends or longer, are primarily designed for groups of up to one dozen participants, but can be adapted to fit in with particular interests and requirements.The programme varies depending on the time of year and other factors
