Let us know if you have any particular interest or skills that you would be prepared to share with the group. Can you open an oyster? steer a small boat? Are you interested in edible plants? 
Remember, we believe in learning by doing and in sharing our knowledge and experience.

Membership gives access to the programme of activities as well as the opportunity to put a group together and, with the help of our various partners, organise an event to suit your own interests and requirements.  

We can help with accommodation, boat charters, fishing trips, foraging excursions, island picnicks, oyster evenings at the boathouse with a guest chef and sommelier, and lots more besides. In fact, to coin a phrase, the world is our oysters.
