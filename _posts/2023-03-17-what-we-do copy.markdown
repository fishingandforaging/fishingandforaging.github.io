Extraction and processing of raw materials from the sea has been one of the basic prerequisites for survival and development in Bohuslän since time immemorial.

The inshore waters of the Swedish west coast are home to some of the finest shellfish in the world and at least twenty edible species are to be found in the coastal waters of northern bohuslän.  Very few of these species are commercially exploited.

We work primarily with the following;
Oysters (pacific and native), Blue mussels, Norway lobster, Brown crab and Lobster.

We also work with some less common species such as cockles, whelks, winkles, razor shell, green crab and shallow water shrimp.
And we forage the beach and islands for edible plants, wild fruits and edible mushrooms.

The programme varies depending on the time of year and other factors
and can be adapted to fit in with individual interests and requirements.

Generally, interest in shellfish is considerable whilst knowledge is often limited.

Our courses are intended to take advantage of that interest, share our accumulated knowledge, and learn how satisfying it can be to harvest, handle, prepare and, not least of all, consume and enjoy what nature, and the sea In particular, have to offer.

The courses are designed for groups of up to one dozen participants. Guests find their own way out to the boathouse on Nøtholmen or are picked up in Strömstad. 

A weekend course might start with an ‘oyster evening’ on friday or, alternatively, ‘brunch’  on saturday morning.  We improve our skills in opening oysters and preparing oysters and mussels for the table. We're given an overview of the species. What should we think about when harvesting or buying and preparing shellfish? Are there different fishing methods and cultivation possibilities? Is there a risk of toxins and other hazards?  We try to ensure that the information is accessible, reliable and interesting. 

Then we go to sea.  Half an hour's steaming brings us to the first crab pots (or lobster in season) or an hour to our fleets of prawn creels. Returning, we visit the beautiful island of Syd Längö and the narrow sound where we pick oysters and take a well-earned picnic lunch (grilled oysters avec?) Then a hike across the island, along the beach, through forest and across meadows in search of edible plants, berries and mushrooms.

Eventually we return to the söboden at Nötholmen where we spend the remainder of the day taking care of the day's harvest, composing the menu, preparing the delicious ingredients and enjoying a world-class meal together.
Our guest chef and (optional) sommelier contribute to the evenings delights.
