saturday course with optional friday-evening intro


The courses are designed for groups of up to one dozen participants. The programme varies depending on the time of year and other factors and can be adapted to fit in with individual interests and requirements.

Guests find their own way out to the boathouse on Nøtholmen or are picked up in Strömstad. 

A weekend course can start with an ‘oyster evening’ on friday or, alternatively, ‘brunch’  on saturday morning.  We improve our skills in opening oysters and preparing oysters and mussels for the table. We're given an overview of the species. What should we think about when harvesting or buying and preparing shellfish? Are there different fishing methods and cultivation possibilities? Is there a risk of toxins and other hazards?  We try to ensure that the information is reliable and interesting. 

Well fortified with food for both body and mind we head for the fishing grounds. Half an hour's steaming brings us to the first crab pots (or lobster in season) or an hour to our fleets of prawn creels. 

Returning with our catch we visit Syd Längö with its safe harbour and narrow sound where we pick oysters and enjoy a well-earned lunch (grilled oysters?) followed by a hike across the island, along the beach, through forest and across meadows in search of edible plants, berries and mushrooms.

Eventually we return to the söboden at Nötholmen where we spend the remainder of the day taking care of the day's harvest, composing the menu, preparing the ingredients and enjoying a world-class meal together. Our guest chef and (optional) sommelier contribute to the experience.
 
Bring; warm clothes, rubber boots/waders or similar, life jacket if you have (otherwise we have)


Shellfish Courses

Learn to harvest, handle, prepare and enjoy what nature has to offer
      
* Go trap-fishing for Norway lobster, Brown crab and European Lobster
* Learn how to harvest and prepare oysters and mussels
* Gather cockles, winkles and shallow-water shrimp
* Forage the beach and islands for edible and medicinal plants, berries and mushrooms

The inshore waters of the Swedish west coast are home to many of the finest shellfish in the world. At least twenty edible species are to be found in the coastal waters of northern bohuslän.

We work primarily with the following;>
* Oysters, pacific (Crassostrea gigas) and native (Ostrea edulis)
* Blue mussels (mytilus edulis)
* Norway lobster (Nephrops norvegicus)
* Brown crab (Cancer pagurus) and the European lobster (Homarus gammarus).

We also work with some less common species such as
cockles (Cerastoderma edule)
whelks (Buccinum undatum)
periwinkles (Littorina littorea)
razor shells (Ensis ensis)
shallow water shrimp (Palaemon elegans, Crangon crangon)
      
In addition we forage the beach and islands for edible plants, wild fruits and edible mushrooms.
Our courses are intended to show how satisfying it is to harvest, handle, prepare and, not least of all, consume and enjoy what nature, and the sea In particular, have to offer.
