Colin Wheatley started fishing on the island of Jersey in the early 1960's working 300 lobster pots out of Rozel under the legendary skipper Bob Viney. In 1964 he moved to London, trained as a journalist and worked in broadcasting for a decade before buying a ruined cottage in the hebrides where he took up lobster fishing once again. Visiting Sweden in the late 70's he bought a 40 foot fishing boat and fished for cod out of Kårehamn, Öland before moving to the west coast where he found employment as a skipper/technician at Tjärnö Marine Laboratory. 

In the early 1980's he pioneered the trap fishery for norway lobster which currently employs more than 100 vessels and contributes significantly to a year-round economy in numerous fishing communities on the Swedish west coast. Throughout the 1990's and up to his retirement in 2008 he was employed by the University of Gothenburg working in fisheries development and coastal zone management, addressing the difficulties confronting small fishing communities in a number of european countries.

Since retirement in 2008 he has worked as crew on a shrimp trawler, participated in various scientific expeditions, renovated a small, wooden fishing boat and, with a little help from his friends, built a boathouse on the harbour where he organises courses in how to catch, prepare and enjoy a variety of shellfish species.
